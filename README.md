# Elysian Enclave


##### **Elysian Enclave is a small side project I dabble in from time to time.**


### Story
The game follows a prospective student of Eldoria Magic Academy who accidentally ends up in the midst of emptiness through a magical portal near the village's ancient ruins. Here, the player hears the voice of an old wise wizard, who guides them out of the void into the material world, namely the Elysian Enclave. Here, guided by the voice of an ancient, wise wizard, the player finds themselves in the material world of Elysian Enclave. Armed with a new grimoire, they must explore and unravel the mysteries of this realm to return to their original world. But could this journey be a mere cycle, reminiscent of a samsara-like phenomenon?


### Info
The game is created using the C++ language with the SFML library for rendering purposes. The quality of the project's code may not be the best, and the solutions may not be the greatest, but for me, the most important thing here is just to have fun and enjoy the process of creating the game.

The project also does not have a set date for when the game will be finished, and in all likelihood, it may never be completed depending on my own motivation and schedule, so don't expect the game to be finished. Please keep this in mind.
